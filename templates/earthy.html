    <h3>History of Earthy Interior Design</h3>
    <p>
        Earthy interior design finds its roots in the desire to create living spaces that are in harmony with nature. This style draws inspiration from various sources, including ancient civilizations that used natural materials and colors in their architecture and decor. The modern interpretation of earthy design gained momentum in the mid-20th century, influenced by the back-to-nature movement and a growing awareness of environmental sustainability.

        Designers like Frank Lloyd Wright, with his emphasis on organic architecture, played a significant role in shaping the earthy interior aesthetic. The use of natural materials, such as wood, stone, and clay, along with an emphasis on eco-friendly practices, has become central to this design philosophy.
