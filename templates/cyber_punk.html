    <h3>History of Cyberpunk Interior Design</h3>
    <p>
        Cyberpunk interior design draws its inspiration from the science fiction genre of the same name, which emerged in the late 20th century. This style is heavily influenced by the dystopian, high-tech, and low-life themes popularized by writers such as William Gibson, with his seminal work "Neuromancer" in 1984, and movies like "Blade Runner" directed by Ridley Scott in 1982. The genre imagines a future where advanced technology and cybernetics coexist with societal decay and urban sprawl.

This style emphasizes a fusion of futuristic elements with an underground, gritty vibe, reflecting the themes of urban decay and technological advancement prevalent in cyberpunk literature and media.
