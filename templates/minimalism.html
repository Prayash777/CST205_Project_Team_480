    <h1>You got <i>Minimalism!</i></h1>
    <br>
    <h3>History of Minimalist Interior Design</h3>
    <p>
        Minimalist interior design finds its roots in the early 20th century, with pioneers like the German Bauhaus movement and architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.
    </p>
    <p>
        These designers championed clean lines, functional furniture, and the idea that form should follow function. The movement gained momentum in the mid-20th century, with artists like Donald Judd and architects like John Pawson pushing the boundaries of minimalism.

    <h3>Minimalist Style Interior Design Characteristics</h3>
    Minimalist interior design is characterized by several key features:

        <li>Open Spaces: Minimalist design often incorporates open floor plans and uncluttered surfaces to create a sense of space.</li>
        <li>Natural Materials: Elements like wood, stone, and metal are used to bring warmth and texture to minimalist interiors.</li>
