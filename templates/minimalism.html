    <h3>History of Minimalist Interior Design</h3>
    <p>
        The early 20th century gave rise to pioneers in the field of minimalist interior design, including architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the German Bauhaus movement.</p>
    <p>
        These designers promoted the notion that form should come after function, as well as simple, well-made furniture. With minimalist architects like John Pawson and painters like Donald Judd pushing the envelope, the trend picked up steam in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <h3>Minimalist Style Interior Design Characteristics</h3>
    Minimalist interior design is characterized by several key features:

        <li><b>Simplicity:</b> Clean lines, neutral colors, and a lack of unnecessary decoration are essential in minimalist spaces.</li>
        <li><b>Functionality:</b> All furniture and decor serve a purpose, and every item has a designated place.</li>
        <li><b>Open Spaces:</b> Minimalist design incorporates open floor plans and uncluttered surfaces creating a sense of space.</li>
        <li><b>Natural Materials:</b> Elements like wood, stone, and metal are used to bring warmth and texture to minimalist interiors.</li>
    </ul>
