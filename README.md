<b>How to run the program</b>
<br>
<br>
This program is straight forward in the sense that as soon as you reach the home page, the program is already running.
After reading the quick intro, the user will be prompted to pick the coolest room, they will then be redirected to the 
next page where they will continue until they receive their "aesthetic". They will then be met with their aesthetic and 
some background information along with the benefits.
