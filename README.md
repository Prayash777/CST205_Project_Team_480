<b>How to run the program</b>
<br>
<br>
This program is straight forward in the sense that as soon as you reach the home page, the program is already running.
After reading the quick intro, the user will be prompted to pick the coolest room, then will be directed to the 
next page where they will continue until they receive their best suiting aesthetic. They will then be met with their decor results and 
with some background information on the style, which might even reveal something about their personality.
